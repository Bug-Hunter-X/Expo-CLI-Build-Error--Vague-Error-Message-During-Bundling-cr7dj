# Expo CLI Build Error: Vague Error Message During Bundling

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when building an Expo project using the Expo CLI. The error message itself is vague, providing little insight into the root cause. This makes debugging challenging.

## Reproducing the Error

The exact steps to reproduce this error vary depending on project setup. However, the problem is typically linked to complexities within the project's build configuration or interactions between different dependencies.  The error often manifests during the Expo build process, preventing successful bundling.

## Solution

The solution requires meticulous debugging. Strategies include:

* **Clean Build:**  Try cleaning the project's cache and performing a fresh build.
* **Dependency Review:** Examine the project's dependencies for potential conflicts or issues. Check for outdated or incompatible packages.
* **Gradual Reduction:** If possible, gradually comment out parts of your code to isolate the problematic section. This helps pinpoint the source of the error.
* **Console Logging:** Add extensive console logs throughout your build process to track variables and the flow of execution. 
* **Detailed Error Search:** Search online for similar errors, focusing on the specific technologies and packages used in your project.
* **Expo Community:** Seek assistance from the Expo community forums or GitHub issues. Provide detailed error messages and relevant project information. 

This example provides a basic structure for demonstrating the problematic build scenario and a potential solution.  The exact code and steps required to reproduce the error are highly dependent on the specific project configuration.
